# SL-II-assignment4
Create a simulator for the heap management schema using linked list as shown in the given figure. The  program output should display the adjacency matrix for the above schema for each Root 1 and Root 2  separately.

I. After the creation of the heap management schema, write a code and implement the following garbage collection methods to find the garbage nodes in the given heap.
  1. Reference Counting method
  2. Mark and Sweep method (mark all the nodes of the tree using constant space (i.e. without using either recursion or a stack)
  
  
Display the output for both the methods in the form of the adjacency matrix separately. Also show the garbage nodes that are no longer required.

II. For the garbage nodes, implement the merge memory technique of free space management and make sure that the adjacent blocks are merged together. Display the size of the freed and merged memory in terms of bytes.
